These data elements would be classified by HL7 as “observations”. The taxonomy is  multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term.  The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis. 	NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations – in effect, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term. Domains and classes are not coded.",2001/05/10 12:00:00,2001/05/10 12:00:00,2001/05/10 04:05:00,,UV

The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code ""potassium"" together with and Act.classCode for ""laboratory observation"" to somehow mean ""potassium laboratory observation"" and then use the same Act.code for ""potassium"" together with Act.classCode for ""medication"" to mean ""substitution of potassium"".

The CCC System consists of two interrelated terminologies: CCC of 176 Nursing Diagnoses( which includes 528 CCC Nursing Outcomes from each nursing diagnoses combined with one of three qualifiers (Improved, stanbilized, or deteriorated) to document the expected or actual outcomes). The second terminology is the CCC of 804 Nursing Interventions which represents 201 Core Nursing Interventions each of which has to be combined with one of four Action Type Qualifiers (Assess/Monitor; Perform/Care. Teach/Instruct, or Manage/Refer).  Both of the terminologies are classified by 21 Care Components to form a single system.  The CCC System consists of a four level structure designed to document nursing practice following the six steps of the nursing process as recommended by the American Nurses Assocation (ANA) as professional nursing practice and for documenting the 'essence of care'. The ANA recognized the CCC System as early as 1992 and was one of the four earliest nursing terminologies designed to document nursing practice electronically in any healthcare setting where nurses function e.g. hospitals, outpatient departments, home health agencies, ambulatory care clinics, and other health care settings. The CCC System was the first nursing terminology to be recognized by the Secretary of HHS as interoperable and usable for documenting in the electronic health record systems. It is available as a free terminology with Permission -- fomr found on its web Site.

It was derived from our knowledge of ICPC, ICD-10, and our aggregate 60-year clinical family medicine experience. Development occurred over a period of approximately ten years and was initially presented internationally at the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC) 1991 under its original name SIN-FM. The product was subsequently enhanced in order to be the standard terminology for the national database of the College of Family Physicians of Canada ""Clinical Practice Management Network"".ENCODE-FM has been designed expressly for use at point of service in primary care. It addresses the issues of ease of data entry and accuracy of aggregate data retrieval in its design, the mapping to other classifications, and choice of words and terms. Published research (use links)(J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc. 3(3): 224-233, 1996; J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc., Symposium Supplement 1995, Vol 20: 135-139. 1996.) has shown that none of the large nomenclatures (each over 100,000 terms) intended to cover the whole health care system, describe all clinical content or even all diseases. Alternatively, ENCODE-FM was designed to do one part of that task well - namely to be a CLINICAL terminology of ONLY symptoms, complaints, diagnoses, disorders and reasons for encounter for use in primary care electronic records. It is intended to facilitate data entry by the caregiver, and to allow data aggregation by the 3 internationally recognized classifications of disease used most commonly in primary care  ICPC, ICD-10, and ICD09CM.It was also designed to be an evolving terminology, so that as the terminology and usage of medical terms changes, ENCODE can be readily updated with the changes. ENCODE-FM currently contains 9378 terms.http://www.insite-fm.com/Products/ENCODE-FM",2006/03/25 12:00:00,2009/12/28 12:00:00,2009/12/28 06:47:12,,UV

This code system is partitioned into three sections: Affiliate realms, Binding realms and Namespace realms. All affiliate realm codes may automatically be used as both binding realms and namespace realms. Furthermore, affiliate realms are the only realms that have authority over the creation of binding realms. (Note that 'affiliate' includes the idea of both international affiliates and the HL7 International organization.) All other codes must be associated with an owning affiliate realm and must appear as a specialization of _BindingRealm or _NamespaceRealm. For affiliates whose concepts align with nations, the country codes from ISO 3166-1 2-character alpha are used for the code when possible so these codes should not be used for other realm types. It is recommended that binding realm and namespace codes submitted by affiliates use the realm code as a prefix to avoid possible collisions with ISO codes. However, tooling does not currently support namepace realm codes greater than 2 characters.Where the realms correspond to countries, the ISO 3166-1 2-character alpha codes are used, otherwise new coded values are created.  See HL7 V3 documentation for the use of Binding Realm codes.  Note that there may be some 3-character codes.Note that in 2009, this code system was extended to cover namespace realms as well as binding realms.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary.

In HL7 v2 messages, this LOINC code is used in OBX-3 with a coded result (CWE data type) that will be sent in OBX-5. The value of the coded result is an ISCN expression, and ISCN will be the code system for the coded result. Versioning is identified by the year of publication of the ISCN.

The NUBC was formed to develop a single billing form and standard data set that could be used nationwide by institutional providers and payers for handling health care claims, the current UB-04 manual.In determining the data to be included, the NUBC strives to balance the need for the information against the burden of providing that information. In essence it applies the administrative simplification principles mentioned in the recently enacted Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Data elements identified as necessary for claims processing are, in most cases, assigned designated spaces on the form. The designated spaces are referred to as Form Locators and each one has a unique number.

In contrast to the inpatient setting, outpatient prescribing must be specific as to dosage form and strength. Attributes of the MEDID provide drug information and access to clinical and patient education modules within NDDF Plus.The fdbMEDID is the primary clinical drug concept distributed by FDB that is used to represent the clinical drug when prescribing, ordering or when generating a list of active patient medications.  It spans both generically named and branded concepts and is very analogous to the RxNorm ""Semantic Brand Drug"" (SBD) and the RxNorm ""Semantic Clinical Drug"". In the context of HL7, the fdbMEDID would most likely be used when compiling a structured medication component for the CCD record.  For stage 1 Meaningful Use, the fdbMEDID may be used to report the coded medication in the absence of an RxNorm code; for stage 2, it is likely that the fdbMEDID will be sent as a ""translation Code"" to represent the code associated to the value selected by the end user in the application as a companion to the ""interoperable Code"" which most likely will be RxNorm based.Within the HL7 CDA Medications Section, the fdbMEDID may be used to identify the enterprise coded medication value used in the context of a ""history of medication use,"" ""medications administered,"" or ""active medications"" (e.g., ""coded product name,"" ""coded brand name"").Within the HL7 CDA Allergy/Drug-Sensitivity Section, may be used to identify the enterprise coded medication value when used in the context of a ""product coded"".",2011/11/21 12:00:00,2011/11/21 12:00:00,2011/11/22 09:31:40,,US

This number is a stable identifier. It is the most specific name concept in FDB MedKnowledge (NDDF Plus). This number is a stable identifier.Expamples of its use primary use include end user navigation from a text string to orderable or dispensable medication selection targets. Secondly, the fdbMedNameID may be used within proprietary allergy or drug-sensitivity documentation applications in the context of a medication ""allergen.""  For example,the term ""Bactrim"" (fdb MedNameID = 5086) may be selected as a patient medication allergen.  When screening prospective medications for potential allergies, ingredients associated to the fdb MedNameID are fetched in support of allergy detection algorithms.  In the case of ""Bactrim,"" the ingredients ""trimethoprim"" and ""sulfamethoxazole"" would be fetched as related ingredient allergens.For interoperable medication allergen exchange, branded fdbMedNameID values will be cross-referenced to RxNorm Brand Names (example, ""Bactrim"" = RXCUI 151399, Terminology Type = BN); generically named fdbMedNameID values will be linked to RxNorm ingredients (e.g., Ingredient [IN], Precise Ingrdient [PIN] or Multiple Ingredient {MIN]). In the context of HL7, the fdbMedNameID would most likely be used when compiling a structured medication allergen within the Allergy Observation for a CDA document.  Within the United States, it is expected that for brand-name based medication allergens, the RxNorm Brand Name would be exchanged as the interoperable code and the fdbMedNameID would be included as the ""translation Code"" to represent the code associated to term selected by the end user within FDB supported systems.

CMS released the proposed OPPS rules using the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) system in the September 8, 1998 Federal Register. Final regulations were published in the April 7, 2000 Federal Register and the system became effective for Medicare on August 1, 2000.The APC-based OPPS developed by CMS is the outpatient equivalent of the inpatient, DRG-based PPS. The APC system establishes groups of covered services so that the services within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources.Hospitals are required to use HCPCS when billing for outpatient services.The OCE not only identifies individual errors but also indicates what actions should be taken and the reasons why these actions are necessary. In order to accommodate this functionality, the OCE is structured to return lists of edit numbers. This structure facilitates the linkage between the actions being taken, the reasons for the actions and the information on the claim (e.g., a specific diagnosis) that caused the action. In general, the OCE performs all functions that require specific reference to HCPCS codes, HCPCS modifiers and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for historical claims with From Dates prior to 10/1/2015). Since these coding systems are complex and annually updated, the centralization of the direct reference to these codes and modifiers in a single program reduces effort and reduces the chance of inconsistent processing.This is a CMS maintained list of edits: Please see the following for additional information: &#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/index.html&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/Background.htmlC&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/OCEQtrReleaseSpecs.htmlThese fields are used in grouping and reimbursement for CMS APCs.
